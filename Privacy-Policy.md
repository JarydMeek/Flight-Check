# This is simple. 

There is nothing collected by the app, and all information is kept on your local device.

The only outside sources used for this app are official FAA and DOD sources and the only data that is transmitted to the source organizations is the ICAO code entered.

No data will ever go anywhere else, and this can be verified in the source code.

Privacy is important. :)
